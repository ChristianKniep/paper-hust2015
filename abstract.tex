The IT infrastructure (no matter the size) is composed of multiple layers, supplied by different comercial vendors as well
as more and more open source project. This increasing complexity needs to be addressed by defining a common sense framework
to consume,process,explore data; no matter if it is metrics data, event information and inventory data.

The innovation cyle is becoming faster and faster and thus the need to integrate new services need to keep pace.

In this paper QNIBMon is introduced, which serves as an open framework to consume, process, store and make use of
bit and pieces of information originating from each layer of the infrastruture stack.
QNIBMon utilizes Docker as a foundation of a Microservice architecture and makes use of the best-of-breed open-source technologies
such as Graphite (metrics engine), Logstash (event pipeline) and Neo4J (graph database).
