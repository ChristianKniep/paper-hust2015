The IT infrastructure (no matter the size) is composed of multiple layers, supplied by different comercial vendors as well
as more and more open source project. This increasing complexity needs to be addressed by defining a common sense framework
to consume,process,explore data; no matter if it is metrics data, event information and inventory data.

The innovation cyle is becoming faster and faster and thus the need to integrate new services need to keep pace.
%In the pre-commodity beginning of IT infrastructure big chunks of the datacenters were overarched by IT integrators
%which provided some level of interaction between the different layers.
%Todays infrastructure is constructed by common off-the-shelf technology, no matter if it is proprietory or open source software.

In this paper QNIBMon is introduced, which serves as an open framework to consume, process, store and make use of
bit and pieces of information originating from each layer of the infrastruture stack.
