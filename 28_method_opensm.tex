The management of InfiniBand is centralized and coped with by one daemon per subnet. This service holds the inventory,
computes the routing tables for each switch, reacts on events within the network et cetera.
The OpenFabrics Alliance\footnote{\Mundus~\url{http://www.openfabrics.org/}} provides an open-source implementations called OpenSM\footnote{\Mundus~\url{http://git.openfabrics.org/}}.


Fabriscale\footnote{\Mundus~\url{http://fabriscale.com/}} has extended OpenSM,
to provide better routing capabilities alongside with enhancements in operational aspects.
By providing a RESTful API the daemon \texttt{fabriscale}, is a good fit to be integrated in
a microservice architecture. Furthermore it provides a plugin to extract performance information and send these off to the metrics engine.
