\subsection{Traditional Approach}
Existing inventory systems face a twofold problem. First they are mostly designed by one paricular layer of the infrastrucure cake.
This burdens certain constraints to the model of the system, which are hard to overcome. A holistic approach is very rare, some might
provide a global character, but most likely as an historicaly grown extension.

The second problem comes down to the technique used. Most systems use some sort of Rational Database, which has a tendency to normalise
the schemas involved to eliminate redundant information. Once a schema is set up, it is hard to shoehorn other aspects of the datacenter into
the established schema formed by the first consideration.

To overcome this, the system should backed by a graph database, which allows a schema-free model to evolve over time. Different aspects
use different models. Inter-layer dependencies are modeled by connecting the related nodes. This allows a rich query to span accros multiple layers.
