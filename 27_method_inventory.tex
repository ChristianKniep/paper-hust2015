Existing inventory systems face a twofold problem. First they are mostly designed for one particular layer of the infrastructure cake.
This burdens certain constraints to the model of the system, which are hard to overcome. A holistic approach is very rare, some might
provide a global character, but most likely as an historically grown extension.

The second problem comes down to the technique used. Most systems use some sort of Rational Database, which has a tendency to normalize
the schema involved to eliminate redundant information. Once a schema is set up, it is hard to shoehorn other aspects of the data-center into
the established schema formed by the first consideration.

To overcome this, the system should be backed by a graph database, which allows a schema-free model to evolve over time. Different aspects
use different models. Inter-layer dependencies are modeled by connecting the related nodes. This allows a rich query to span across multiple layers.
