\section{Conclusion}
Over all this approach provides a framework which allows rapid prototyping and integration of services into the scheme. By leveraging the service discovery the configuration
overhead is minimized and the software stack configures itself for the most part.

While not tested at scale QNIBMon works nicely as an testing envirnment.

By being extremely modular the framework is able to adapt very quickly.
