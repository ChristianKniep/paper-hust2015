- the OpenSM section should be made a little bit more general, with OpenSM as a good example of how it should be done?
Maybe entitled "The importance of (good) APIs"?
    
[conclusion]

- the conclusion should probably be fleshed out a bit more, to give it more oompfh; people typically check the abstract & conclusion first,
to see if the paper is worth reading; you should also mention the use case of correlating info between IB & SLURM,
since that would get people's attention imho
