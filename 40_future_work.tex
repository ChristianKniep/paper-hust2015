\section{Future Work}

The coupling of metrics, log events and inventory data is still an area which is researched and therefore it is not battletested.

\subsection{Data Back-end}
When talking to different camps within the space it seems that each back-end is a good fit to cover all needs.
Some say, it is safe to store metric information in Elasticsearch. On the other hand InfluxDB supports storing events and so on.

In the future the right balance, back-end and connectivity has to be found.

\subsection{Metrics 2.0}
Aligning the metrics2.0 concept to allow tighter and more specific reference of tags might help connect information.
Tags might implicitly describe to which data-point (inventory or event) they are referring to.

\subsection{Inventory Model}
More domain models have to be included into the Inventory system to gain more experience in regards of possible friction points and limitation to this approach.

\subsection{Scale Test}
The use of this framework is so far limited to small clusters and a laptop. How well it is going to scale and what the limitations are is to be discovered.
