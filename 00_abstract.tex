IT infrastructure, no matter the size, is composed of multiple layers, supplied by different commercial vendors and increasingly open-source projects.
This increasing complexity needs to be addressed by a common sense framework to consume,
process and explore the data produced by any part of the system; no matter if it is metrics, event or inventory information.

The pace of innovation is becoming faster and faster and thus the integration of new services has to keep pace. Long integration cycles
will become to be a handicap in a competitive, ever changing world.

In this paper a framework is introduced, which serves as an open framework to consume, process and store information originating from each infrastructure layer.
The framework uses Docker as the foundation of a microservice architecture and integrates best-of-breed open-source technologies
such as \gls{graphite}, \gls{logstash} and \gls{neo4j}.
This approach provides an inter-layer correlation capabilities which allows connections between subsystems like network,
software inventory and resource scheduler to assist in complex analysis of problems and performance. A practical example is introduced which correlates Infiniband
performance metrics with job-related information obtained from SLURM.
