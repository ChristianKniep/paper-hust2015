The IT infrastructure (no matter the size) is composed of multiple layers, supplied by different commercial vendors as well
as more and more open source project. This increasing complexity needs to be addressed by defining a common sense framework
to consume,process,explore data; no matter if it is metrics data, event information and inventory data.

The innovation cycle is becoming faster and faster and thus the need to integrate new services need to keep pace.

In this paper QNIBMon is introduced, which serves as an open framework to consume, process, store and make use of
bit and pieces of information originating from each layer of the infrastructure stack.
QNIBMon utilizes Docker as a foundation of a Micro-service architecture and makes use of the best-of-breed open-source technologies
such as \gls{graphite} (\glsdesc{graphite}), \gls{logstash} (\glsdesc{logstash}) and \gls{neo4j} (\glsdesc{neo4j}).
This approach provides a inter-layer methodology which allows connections between subsystems like network, software inventory and resource scheduler to
assist the system operator in complex analysis.
